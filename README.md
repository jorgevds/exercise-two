# exercise-two

First exercises I've done: attempted to copy an existing webpage. Took a very long time and fell apart once I wanted to introduce more content than just the very top part. Still happy with how part of the navbar turned out. Abandoned since then to work on other, better projects.

HR people, please ignore this repo. It is not indicative of my work or capabilities. Or my work ethic for that matter. A very fruitful exercise that I don't think I need to continue.
